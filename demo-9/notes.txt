After instance creation
1. Login with ssh
2. df -h (file system disk usage)
3. mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdh (for creating filesystem)
4. create a directory /data
5. mount /dev/xvdh /data
6. df -h (it should the mounted drive with /data)
7. mount will not be available when you reboot the system. To resolve do following
  nano /etc/fstab
  /dev/xvdh /data ext4 defaults 0 0 
  (To better understand 0 0 $man fstab)
8. for unmounting data
   umount /data (without /dev/xvdh)
   mount /data
